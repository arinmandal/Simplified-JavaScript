//? Working with Variable
// TODO Task 1:
/*Declare two variables: admin and name.
Assign the value "John" to name.
Copy the value from name to admin.
Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
*/
let admin, name;
name = 'John';
admin = name;
// alert(admin); // Output: John

// TODO Task 2:
/*Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
*/
let ourPlanetName = 'Earth';
let currentVisitorName = 'John';

//? Working with Data Types
// Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.
// alert(1 / 0); // Output: Infinity

// NaN (Not a Number) is a special value that represents an operation that cannot be performed. For instance:
// alert("not a number" / 2); // Output: NaN

// Seven primitive data types:
//* number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
//* bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
//* string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
//* boolean for true/false.
//* null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
//* undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
//* symbol for unique identifiers.
//* And one non-primitive data type:
//* object for more complex data structures.
